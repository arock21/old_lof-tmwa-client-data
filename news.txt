##1 Welcome to Land of Fire

##0 Heya all, TMW-LoF V2 is in
##0 progress. Many new quests will
##0 be added and changed, and we
##0 are updating to newest TMW
##0 content to keep up to date
##0 with the main server, while
##0 still being our own flavour
##0 of TMW. While this is in
##0 progress, not much will be
##0 added to the current server.
##0 We apologize for the wait 
##0 but it will be worth it.
##0 Have fun!
##0
##0 We have moved the server to
##0 Platinum, some speed issues
##0 should be resolved.
##0 Nothing has changed except for
##0 the port you connect to, and
##0 manaplus has already updated that.
##0 Have fun!
##0
##0 Heya all, some updates are coming.
##0 There is no set date but the
##0 quests written by our own player
##0 Ozthokk are in the process of
##0 being scripted, as well as
##0 the server is being rebuilt upon
##0 new TMW content, and many changes
##0 will occur. Visit our forums and
##0 look around for more info!
