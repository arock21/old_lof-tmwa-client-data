##1 Welcome to Land of Fire

##0 Heya all, some updates are coming.
##0 There is no set date but the
##0 scripting of our own player
##0 Ozthokk's quest is in the process
##0 of being scripted. Have fun!
##0
##0 For those worried about the server
##0 disappearing once the new game is
##0 ready, do not fret. If we cannot
##0 locate a new host, we will continue
##0 hosting until someone volunteers.
##0 We have backups that can be
##0 transferred to a new host so
##0 there is no risk of data loss.
##0 We apologize for any cause of
##0 thought that a players time here
##0 would be in vain. Have fun!
##0 
##0
##0 All of the old news is now gone, do
##0 not be alarmed... Development
##0 of the new LoF is in progress
##0 and we are hard at work on it.
